Below is our guidance for how to submit contributions via Pull Requests (PRs).

# Testing

To validate your pull request, your changes have to pass tests using: `pytest`.

# Submitting changes

Prefer atomic commits (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
´´´
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
´´´
